As per recommendation i use yarn ..The wine data is in form of csv file so i covert csv file in json file and then pick some data from the json file . because theri were abudant data whichever i cant adjust in chart that why i just pick some data then shoot the data in barchart and scatterplotchart.i didnt use typescript , i am honest with u that i got some problem in typescript that why use jsx file , but if i select for this i ll learn typescript syntax before interview.
